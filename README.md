Hello, I'm Ryan, a driven graduate student currently pursuing my Master's in Artificial Intelligence at Northeastern University. Prior to this, I proudly earned my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science with first-class honors from Heriot-Watt University, where my passion for research led me to publish a conference paper for ICITA 2023, now available on Springer.

During my academic journey, I seized the opportunity to expand my horizons as a Data Science intern at a leading AI solutions company in the Middle East. This invaluable experience allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical projects, honing my skills in real-world AI applications.

I've further fortified my expertise through professional certifications, including the IBM AI Engineering and Applied AI Certificates from Coursera, complementing my academic achievements. Additionally, I've demonstrated proficiency in English with an IELTS score of 8.5.

Eager to collaborate with like-minded professionals in artificial intelligence and machine learning, I'm committed to pushing the boundaries of AI innovation and making impactful contributions to the field. Let's connect and explore the possibilities together.
