# Hey, I'm Ryan 👋

ML Engineer building deployable AI systems. MS in Artificial Intelligence from Northeastern University, published researcher in Computer Vision ([Springer LNNS](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-99-8324-7_16)).

I care about building things that work in production, not just in notebooks.
